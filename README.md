# Zomato Bangalore Restaurant Analysis
 
## Project Description:
This project focuses on analysing Zomato's restaurant data in Bangalore to enhance customer satisfaction, improve restaurant performance, and boost ratings. Using Tableau, the goal is to identify popular cuisines, optimize delivery services, and uncover patterns in restaurant performance across different locations.

## Project Objectives:
1. Restaurant Performance & Customer Interaction:
* Distribution of ratings across Bangalore and correlation with service quality.
* Popular restaurant types (e.g., Quick Bites, Casual Dining) and their performance.
* The relationship between reviews and ratings (low correlation of 0.149).
* Table booking availability and its impact on customer satisfaction.
2. Neighbourhood & Cost Analysis:
* Availability of online ordering by location and areas with low adoption.
* Average cost for two people by restaurant type and location.
* Correlation between pricing and ratings (moderate correlation of 0.3852).
3. Dining Trends & Popular Choices:
* Popular dishes and cuisines (South Indian, North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food).
* Preferences for comfort foods like desserts and fast food.
* Filtering capabilities to analyse specific locations and restaurant categories.
  
## Key Insights:
* Quick Bites dominate the restaurant landscape, with high demand for online ordering.
* Higher-priced restaurants tend to have better ratings, but affordability is important.
* Customer satisfaction is not always linked to the number of reviews received.
* Expanding online ordering and improving table booking availability could enhance competitiveness.
  
## Techniques Used:
* Data Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards in Tableau for easy exploration of data.
* Correlation Analysis: Finding relationships between cost, ratings, and customer satisfaction.
* Comparative Analysis: Comparing performance across locations and restaurant types.
* Trend Analysis: Identifying popular cuisines and dishes to target customer preferences.
 
## Conclusion:
The analysis provides valuable insights for Zomato to optimize its restaurant services in Bangalore. Enhancing online ordering in underperforming areas, improving engagement with customers, and focusing on popular cuisines can help boost customer satisfaction and business growth.
